# ChessBot  - WIP 
2 Player Chess + ChessAI

My first time creating chess and a chessbot, includes a devlog for your reading pleasure.
Though I have alot of experience with chess as a game and ML, I do not have significant experience in OOP, game design or mechanics of chessbot under the hood. This is mainly a project to get a deeper understanding of the ML workings within chess, while improving my weaknesses and learning new CS concepts in the chess domain!
