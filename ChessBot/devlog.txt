Total Work/Learning Hours: 24


04/08/24 - Project beginnings:
This project may be too big, and may be too complicated to learn in the 5 days I have given myself - but that will not stop me from trying. By the end of this I hope to have learnt a lot about
chess bot mechanics, best move selection, decision tree implementation? and managing a project with multiple unique moving parts that must function as one. This is very exciting for me as I am
sure there will be a lot of problems and learning opportunities each day. 
I will be updating this log with my daily progress, goals for the next days, challenges and general thoughts as I go through. 
//
Today I completed: 
    - Game board
    - Game pieces + starting positions 
    - Implemented the board to remember game position
    - Began work on the drag and drop feature
    - Movement + Captures
//

05/08/24 - BitBoards and Pieces
Initial thoughts: Now realising I need to restructure all the code into OOP and change the boards and movement under the hood to use bitboards to make the later stages of alphabeta pruning, minimax 
and other computations faster. Not feeling too good about this task but I am sure I will learn a lot and more coding never hurt anyone. 

                **I am quickly realising that this project is turning into a comprehensive study of bitwise operations and bit manipulation**

There was a big learning curve with this session, tomorrow will feel a lot easier I'm sure. I look forward to the next steps of implementation where hopefully I will have completed legal move checker! 
In my mind, this is half the battle as the pruning and board state selection is a lot more up my alley :D
Final thought from today are that the code feels like a step back as I have lost some features, but have made leaps and bounds in understanding of the methods I will be using moving forwards, so I see 
this as a win. 
//
Today I completed: 
    - Reworked board to function with new bitboard
    - Began structuring bitboards
    - Got the visuals/piece selection working again (WIP)
    - Many hours of research and reading

07/08/24->08/08/24 - Break 
Initial thoughts: I have made alot of progress on the learning front but have struggled to convert my fragments of knowledge into a cohesive form. Taking a break from the project - I will come back to it 
after I get more research done.

I think my current learning road blocks are: 
    - The lack of learning content in a form I am used to, this has slowed down my learning rate as I am reading many different sources and trying to understand their language and theory without visual examples
    - Lack of a community to ask for clarification on concepts I do not understand. 

How I intend to overcome these when I return: 
    - Work on the chess bot to learn more concepts and then work backwards from there
    - Focus learning on how to select specific pieces and precompute their move maps
