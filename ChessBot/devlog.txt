04/08/24 - Project beginnings:
This project may be too big, and may be too complicated to learn in the 5 days I have given myself - but that will not stop me from trying. By the end of this I hope to have learnt alot about
chess bot mechanics, best move selection, decision tree implementation? and managing a project with multiple unique moving parts that must function as one. This is very exciting for me as I am
sure there will be alot of problems and learning opportunities each day. 
I will be updating this log with my daily progress, goals for the next days, challenges and general thoughts as I go through.

    - Game board
    - Game pieces + starting positions 
    - Implemented the board to remember game position
    - Began work on the drag and drop feature
